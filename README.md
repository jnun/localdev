# localdev
A local development environment 

For the purpose of organizing a centralized, updated list of tools with proven instructions on installing, maintaining, and occasionally abandoning development tools.

In most cases, we can assume the user is on Mac or Linux. Since AI and VR / immersion tech is largely built on Windows dev stacks, we will be outlining those workstations as well.

## rules

* All contributions must include time sensitive details, like OS versions supported
* All contributions must be tested
* Outdated outlines will be marked as expired
* No guessing, only proven and extensively tested scripts allowed
