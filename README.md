# localdev
A local development environment 

## why

Why create yet another repository? Maybe we will join this to a bigger, more popular collection if one is better maintained with a better community of supporters.

The purpose here is to organize a good, centralized, and most importantly updated list of tools with proven instructions on installing, maintaining, and occasionally abandoning development tools. A simple, centralized "done for you" set of scripts for getting to work fast makes setting up a new workstation easier.

When material or tools are outdated, they are abandoned. This is meant for development environments used right now. We want a centralized, simplified, deploy fast development environment that assumes maximum best practices.

No trash, no guesses, community supported.

All contributions are assumed to be public domain, personal contributions available for public domain, or otherwise notated.

## license

100% of the material contributed to this repository are assumed to be public domain.

Copyright material must be notated as such, legally allowed to be used or quoted, or less than 20% of the content when used as an example.

In many cases, we can assume the user is on Mac or Linux. Since AI and VR / immersion tech is largely built on Windows dev stacks, we will be outlining those workstations as well.

## rules

* All contributions must include time sensitive details, like OS versions supported
* All contributions must be tested
* Outdated outlines will be marked as expired
* No guessing, only proven and extensively tested scripts allowed
